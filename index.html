            <p>A survey of more than 4,100 households by financial comparison site Canstar Blue identified the average quarterly electricity bills across the states and territories.</p>

            <p>State-by-state breakdown of average quarterly electricity bill in Australia:</p>

                    <tr>

            <p>According to the Department of Climate Change, Energy, Environment and Water, and the SA Department of Energy and Mining the most energy-consuming activities are:</p>
            <h3>Heating/cooling - 40%</h3>
            <p>Heating/cooling consumes by far the most energy on average for an Australian household. Here are a few ways to cut down the cost:</p>
            <p>In the summertime, try using a fan before switching on the air conditioner.</p>
            <p>But if you find it's so hot and humid that an air conditioner is desperately needed, try to set the temperature between 23 and 26 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>The Energy Efficiency Council says each degree below this can increase your electricity bill by as much as 15 per cent.</p>
            <p>If you're looking to use the heating, set it between 18C and 20C.</p>
            <p>But if you're trying to keep cool, you could also combine your air conditioner with a fan. This could save you 70 per cent of your electricity usage, according to research by Ollie Jay, a professor of heat and health at the University of Sydney.</p>
        
            <h3>Hot water - 25%</h3>
            <p>Replacing your old hot water system with a more efficient model could reduce your running costs.</p>

            <h3>Electronics - 14%</h3>
            <p>Replacing your old hot water system with a more efficient model could reduce your running costs.</p>
            <p>This includes appliances and devices such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>TVs</li>
                <li>Computers</li>
                <li>Gaming consoles</li>
                <li>Music and entertainment systems</li>
                <li>Home office equipment</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Generally, most electronic appliances tend to enter a stand-by mode rather than fully powering down. So while you're asleep or away from home, they're working behind the scenes, sucking your electricity and cash.</p>
            <p>According to Canstar Blue estimates, appliances on stand-by mode could cost you up to 10 per cent of your electricity bill each. That's more than $100 annually.</p>

            <h3>Fridge and freezers - 8%</h3>
            <p>The fridge is one of those appliances that unfortunately, you have no choice but to run 24/7. This is why choosing the right size and efficiency for your requirements can make all the difference to your energy bill.</p>
            <p>Here are some simple ways to reduce fridge costs</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Check the temperature:</span> Adjust your fridge to 3C and freezer to -18C for the best balance between coolness, food safety, and energy efficiency</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Check the placement:</span> Fridges placed in warm areas use more energy to stay cool. Make sure it's in a well-ventilated space and that there are sufficient gaps around the unit</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Maintenance:</span> Is food going off faster than it used to? Is it noisy? It could be worth checking the door seals are clean and brushing off any dusty coils on the back of the fridge</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Contents:</span> A full fridge is a happy fridge because the thermal mass of its contents help maintain temperature and reduce running costs</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Cooking appliances — 5%</h3>

            <h3>Laundry — 4%</h3>
